# rebol-core-fr
repo for Rebol core doc documentation translated in french

This is my french translation of the Rebol Core 2.5 documentation (a piece of my personal history).  
Rebol is an incredible langage created and designed by Carl Sassenrath, see http://www.rebol.com  but now stopped in its development. 
Some forks exists, but especially the RED language (see http://www.red-lang.org) , a next-gen programming language, strongly inspired by REBOL, 
with as its beginning Dockimbel (Nenad Rakocevic) and Qtxie as designers and creators.

This french translation was sent to Carl in 2005, and he posted it on the Rebol site : http://www.rebol.com/docs/core-fr/fr-index.html 

This is a contribution to Rebolers and maybe, Red developers.
